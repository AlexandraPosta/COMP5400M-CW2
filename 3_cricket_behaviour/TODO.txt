TODO:
1. Collect cricket sounds (various accepted frequency and beats within the cricket
mating "range") [DONE]
2. Create simulation master class [DONE]
3. Make cricket up to scale. Maybe environment in 100x100cm grid? (cricket 2.54cm).
How big the step towards sound? [DONE]
4. Define continuous control for agent based on steering angle [PROGRESS]
5. Run simulations with model to tune environemnt (path sound be less than 2 times 
lenghts of the distance)
6. Run 10 final vanilla simulations to show the movement of the agent
7. Introduce memory in the directional movement (short-time). Set a time scale for the
movement. Rerun 10 simulations. Any differences?
8. Introduce slightly longer term memory (30 minutes). Rerun 10 simulations. Any differences?
9. Given two male crickets, can you obvserve any differences with memory?


Literature Review
- Using robots to model animals: a cricket test 
    - For the female cricket, finding the male in a noisy environment, walking through
    a complex habitat, with limited neural processing power, requires some means of 
    constantly adjusting its direction according to current sensory cues to get it to
    the target.
    - Understanding biological systems will not only provide a set of similar tricks 
    that may be usefully adapted for robotics, but more importantly will lead to 
    appreciation of the role such devices play in explaining behaviour.
    - Stout and McGhee [32] classify cricket paths as 'direct' to a sound source if 
    the total track length is Fig. 7. Four trials with no sound. less than twice the 
    straight line distance from start to finish.

- Place memory in crickets
    - First attemps of memory introduced

- Olfactory memory capacity of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus
    - Define memory capabilities for smell

- Auditory orientation in crickets: Pattern recognition controls reactive steering:
    - The increase in gain of auditory steering by pattern recognition on a time scale of 
    seconds has considerable consequences for cricket behavior. Because the animals use 
    reactive steering responses to sound pulses, they do not calculate an overall walking 
    direction. Instead, the walking path in crickets emerges from sequential steering 
    reactions toward the maleâ€™s song. (12, 13). Therefore, the directionality of walking 
    is lost as soon as the sound signal ceases.
    - therefore, imagine you create a steering tendency in the female behaviour when the
    male sound is played that aids the path planning abilities. Some kind of memory
        -> create graph with female going towards male without memory
        -> then with memory

- Learning and memory in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus
Crickets have memory: they use visual cues to remember paths taken in the past and
olfactory, remembering 8 different odors.
    -> what about auditory memory? There is no study associated with audio memory
    -> directional memory?
