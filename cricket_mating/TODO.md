TODO:

- [x] Collect cricket sounds (various accepted frequency and beats within the cricket
      mating "range")
- [x] Create simulation master class
- [x] Make cricket up to scale. Maybe environment in 10x10m grid? (cricket 2.54cm).
      How big the step towards sound?
- [x] Define control for agent based on steering angle
- [x] Run simulations with model to tune environemnt (path sound be less than two times
      lenghts of the distance)
- [x] Run 5 final vanilla simulations to show the movement of the agent
- [x] Introduce memory in the directional movement (short-time). Set a time scale for the
      movement. Rerun 5 simulations. Any differences? (one step every 3.5s -> 10 steps ->
      about 35 seconds memory)
