TODO:
1. Collect cricket sounds (various accepted frequency and beats within the cricket
mating "range") [DONE]
2. Create simulation master class [DONE]
3. Make cricket up to scale. Maybe environment in 100x100cm grid? (cricket 2.54cm).
How big the step towards sound? [DONE]
4. Define continuous control for agent based on steering angle [DONE]
5. Run simulations with model to tune environemnt (path sound be less than 2 times 
lenghts of the distance) [DONE]
6. Run 5 final vanilla simulations to show the movement of the agent [DONE]
7. Introduce memory in the directional movement (short-time). Set a time scale for the
movement. Rerun 5 simulations. Any differences? (one step every 3.5s -> 10 steps -> 
about 35 seconds memory) [DONE]
