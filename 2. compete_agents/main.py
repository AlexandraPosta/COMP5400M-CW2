This is the main file for the compete agents.

The compete agents are agents that are trained to compete against each other in a game.

The rules of the game are as follows:
- The game is a 2-player game
- The game is a live simulation and will simulate the game in real-time
- The 2 players will rush for the closest sound source
- Sound sources will be placed randomly on the map but the catch is that the sound source can only be heard by ears which have a certain radius
- The sound can bang on the walls and the sound will be heard by the ears on the other side of the wall
